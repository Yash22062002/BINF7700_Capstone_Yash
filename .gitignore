# ============================================
# CAPSTONE PROJECT .gitignore
# Project: Evolution of Mutation - SAE Detection in 120 Mammals
# Author: Yash Patel
# ============================================
#
# PURPOSE: This file tells Git which files to IGNORE (not push to GitHub)
# 
# STRATEGY: Keep all directory structures visible on GitHub,
#           but ignore large data files, logs, and binaries inside them
#
# SYNTAX GUIDE:
# - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored by Git)
# - *.ext means "ignore all files ending with .ext"
# - folder/ means "ignore entire folder and its contents"
# - !file means "exception - DO track this file even if it matches ignore pattern"
# - **/pattern means "match pattern in any subdirectory"
#
# ============================================


# =====================================
# LARGE DATA FILES - DO NOT PUSH
# =====================================
# WHY: GitHub has 100 MB file size limit and these files are 13+ GB each
# SOLUTION: Ignore all alignment files, provide download instructions instead

# Ignore MAF files in alignments directory
data/alignments/*.maf
data/alignments/*.maf.gz

# Ignore chromosome-specific files (chr1, chr2, chr3, etc.)
data/alignments/chr*.maf
data/alignments/chr*.maf.gz

# Ignore any alignment files anywhere in the project
*.maf
*.maf.gz

# NOTE: Keep data/alignments/ directory structure by adding README.md there


# =====================================
# LOG FILES - DO NOT PUSH
# =====================================
# WHY: Log files are generated during execution and are not needed in repo
# They can be large and contain system-specific information

# Ignore logs in root logs/ directory
logs/*.log
logs/*.err
logs/*.out

# Ignore logs in scripts/logs/ directory
scripts/logs/*.log
scripts/logs/*.err
scripts/logs/*.out

# Ignore ALL log files anywhere in the project
*.log
*.err
*.out

# NOTE: Keep logs/ directories visible with README files


# =====================================
# SOFTWARE BINARIES - DO NOT PUSH
# =====================================
# WHY: Compiled binaries are large, system-specific, and can be rebuilt

# Ignore entire HyPhy directory (users will install HyPhy themselves)
software/hyphy/

# Ignore Mac metadata folders (created when downloading/extracting on Mac)
software/fresco/fresco_code/
software/fresco/fresco_code/**

software/fresco/__MACOSX/
**/__MACOSX/

# Ignore Mac system files
.DS_Store
**/.DS_Store

# NOTE: We KEEP software/fresco/fresco_code/ because those are the actual
#       FRESCo scripts needed for analysis (see EXCEPTIONS section below)


# =====================================
# RESULTS FILES - DO NOT PUSH
# =====================================
# WHY: Results can be regenerated from analysis scripts
# STRATEGY: Ignore large result files but keep summaries and README files

# Ignore large output files in fresco_output/
results/fresco_output/*.json
results/fresco_output/*.bed
results/fresco_output/*.csv
results/fresco_output/*.txt

# Ignore large files in other result directories
results/boundaries/*.bed
results/boundaries/*.csv
results/comparative/*.csv
results/comparative/*.tsv
results/noncoding/*.bed
results/noncoding/*.txt

# But KEEP summary files and documentation (see EXCEPTIONS below)


# =====================================
# TEMPORARY & CACHE FILES
# =====================================
# WHY: These are system-generated temporary files not needed in repo

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
*~

# Editor backup files
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
.cache/

# R temporary files
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user


# =====================================
# EXCEPTIONS - FORCE INCLUDE THESE
# =====================================
# WHY: Even if patterns above would ignore these, we want to keep them
# SYNTAX: ! means "exception - track this file"

# Always keep README files (they preserve directory structure)
!**/README.md
!README.md

# Always keep documentation
!docs/
!docs/**

# Keep summary files in results (small, important)
!results/**/summary.txt
!results/**/summary.csv
!results/**/SUMMARY.md

# Keep all scripts (your actual code - small and important)
!scripts/**/*.sh
!scripts/**/*.py
!scripts/**/*.R
!scripts/**/*.slurm

# Keep all markdown files (documentation)
!*.md


# =====================================
# PRESERVING EMPTY DIRECTORIES
# =====================================
# GIT NOTE: Git doesn't track empty directories
# SOLUTION: Add README.md files to empty directories (already included above)
#
# Make sure each of these directories has a README.md:
# - data/alignments/
# - data/annotations/
# - data/reference/
# - logs/
# - scripts/logs/
# - results/fresco_output/
# - results/boundaries/
# - results/comparative/
# - results/noncoding/
# - figures/
# - software/
